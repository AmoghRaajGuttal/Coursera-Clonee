## Getting Started

Clone the repo to your local environment, you have to seperately install all the dependencies for backend and frontend. 

For Backend, go to the backend folder (cd Backend) and run 
``` npm i ```

  - Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)
  - or, you can use the [website](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) 
  
  - add your environmental variables
  - Create a .env file in the root directory of the backend folder and add your tokens there with respect to the config files variables.
 
    - ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = "some secret"
    - ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFE = time
    - REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET = "some secret"
    - REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFE = time
    - SENDGRID_KEY = ""
    - MONGO_DATABASE = ""
    - OAuth2Client = ""
    - STRIPE_SECRET_TOKEN = ""
    - REDIS_HOST = ""
    - REDIS_PASSWORD = "" 
    - REDIS_PORT = ""

  ### Note: Make sure the .env files variables matches with that of the config files like the image below.
